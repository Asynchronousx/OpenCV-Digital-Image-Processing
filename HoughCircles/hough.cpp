//Hough Transform: Circles
//The hough transform algorithm is meant to find, given a source image and a certain threshold, 
//all the possible circles into the image. The hough transform is particoular insensible to noise and occlusions.
//Why hough TRANSFORM? Because when operating with Hough, we're analyzing a secondary geometric space called
//PARAMETER SPACE (SP). 
//In the regoular cartesian space, we operate on coordinates (X,Y), and the space where those coordinates works is called
//IMAGE SPACE (SI). In the case of circles, where a circle is expressed by 3 parameters (Center(x,y) and Radius), we got a 
//similalry space called PARAMETER SPACE (SP), where those circles are expressed as points.
//With that said, given a point into the SI, we can identify all the possible circles that fall into that point (X,Y) into the SP,
//with a THETA variation based on the angle analyzed. That's because we're DISCRETIZING the parameter space to host a limited number of corrispondences.
//Similalry, given a point into the SP of coordinate (A,B), we can identify only ONE circonference into SI.
//Then, how do we find a potential circle into the SI? 
//First of all, we need to DISCRETIZE our parameter space, because the circles found could be potentially infinite.
//So, we transfer the calculus from the geometric space to a POLAR SPACE.
//We can identify a point into the SP by the formula:
//a = x - Rcos(THETA), where R is the radius and x is the x-axis coordinate of the center.
//b = y - Rsin(THETA), as above, y is the coordinate of the y-axis.
//Similalry, we can found a SI coordinate by
//x = b + Rcos(THETA)
//y = b + Rsin(THETA)
//THETA represent the variation of the angle of a circle.
//THETA then varies between a certain + or - degree. For example, a circle could vary between 0-360Â°.
//Having a finite space, we must implement a mechanism that could identify a potential circle into our image. This mechanis is called
//VOTING PROCESS, and the logic behind it is simple: Given the entire SP, we must find WHICH point into the SP calculated through Hough has the maximum occurrences.
//Thats because, from the theory, we know that a point into the SP is surely a circle into the SI if his circle intersection number is maximum into the SP.
//That's works for ONE circle. For more than one line, we must set a threshold to let pass all the point with a given number of occurrence > than that threshold.
//Also, we need to set a MAXIMUM RADIUS and a MINIMUM RADIUS, to consider only the circle between that radius.
//Note: before operating with Hough we must works on border: let's do a reasonable Gaussian Blurring and a Canny edge detection.

	//Defining the votes matrix, that represent the parameter space SP in which
	//we'll draw any of the possible circles that belongs to the SI.
	//The size of this matrix should be either 2D or 3Dimensional.
	//From the theory, a 3D matrix should be used only when the radius is unknown.
	//Here we got an interval of radius that space from min radius to max radius.
	//To found the right interval and draw the correct circles, we must analyze all of those intervals.
	//We're going to use a 3D matrix to take advantage of his 3-dimensional structure to memorize, at every
	//iteration, if a point into the SP (a,b) should be voted or not. With the 3-dimension we're going to take 
	//track of a certain radius, a certain a coordinate a (x into the polar space) and b coordinate (y into the polar space).
	//That's comes handy when we need to memorize a certain vote into the votes matrix at A(r,a,b).
	//How we're going to init our matrix?
	
	//First, init a int pointer: we can use an array of three element declared inline.
	//We need three values to take track of all the possible combination of votes: the rows and cols of the image, and the radius numbers.
	//For example, if min radius is 10 and max radius is 20, the possible analyzable elements are 11. (10...20 inclusive)
	//So, (max radius - min radius) + 1 return exactly 11 possible radius to analyze in this specific case.
	//We're going to pass rows and cols of the edged image to represent the space of the rows and the columns.
	//Important note: to build a CORRECT 3D MATRIX, we should need to pass values in descendet orders. 
	//So, if rows are 100, cols 50 and radius 10, we should pass (rows, cols, radius) to make sure the program will not crash 
	//during the computation.
	//In this case, we'll approssimate the values from the biggest (rows) to the smallest (radius). 
	//If cols are major than rows, by few hundreds unit, it's will not make any difference. The important is that radius goes to the end
	//of this array, because it's the smallest of all three.
	int values3D[] = {edge_image.rows, edge_image.cols, (max_radius-min_radius)+1};
	
	//Once done that, we're declaring a Mat object of 3 spaces (3D) composed by values3D fields. Each space
	//will contain the right field. (Mat[0] -> Rows of dimension M, Mat[1] -> Cols of dimension N, Mat[2] -> Radius of dimension r)
	//We create our 3D matrix and fill it with zeros.
	Mat votes3D = Mat(3, values3D, IMREAD_GRAYSCALE, Scalar(0));
	
	//Also, initialize a 2D matrix to take track of the resultant votes image.

						//Example: an image with size of 780x430, means that is a rectangular image shape horizontal oriented.

						//since a is represented by the columns, we should compare a with the cols.
