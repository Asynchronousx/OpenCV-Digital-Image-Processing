//Hough Transform: Circles
//The hough transform algorithm is meant to find, given a source image and a certain threshold, 
//all the possible circles into the image. The hough transform is particoular insensible to noise and occlusions.
//Why hough TRANSFORM? Because when operating with Hough, we're analyzing a secondary geometric space called
//PARAMETER SPACE (SP). 
//In the regoular cartesian space, we operate on coordinates (X,Y), and the space where those coordinates works is called
//IMAGE SPACE (SI). In the case of circles, where a circle is expressed by 3 parameters (Center(x,y) and Radius), we got a 
//similalry space called PARAMETER SPACE (SP), where those circles are expressed as points.
//With that said, given a point into the SI, we can identify all the possible circles that fall into that point (X,Y) into the SP,
//with a THETA variation based on the angle analyzed. That's because we're DISCRETIZING the parameter space to host a limited number of corrispondences.
//Similalry, given a point into the SP of coordinate (A,B), we can identify only ONE circonference into SI.
//Then, how do we find a potential circle into the SI? 
//First of all, we need to DISCRETIZE our parameter space, because the circles found could be potentially infinite.
//So, we transfer the calculus from the geometric space to a POLAR SPACE.
//We can identify a point into the SP by the formula:
//a = x - Rcos(THETA), where R is the radius and x is the x-axis coordinate of the center.
//b = y - Rsin(THETA), as above, y is the coordinate of the y-axis.
//Similalry, we can found a SI coordinate by
//x = b + Rcos(THETA)
//y = b + Rsin(THETA)
//THETA represent the variation of the angle of a circle.
//THETA then varies between a certain + or - degree. For example, a circle could vary between 0-360Â°.
//Having a finite space, we must implement a mechanism that could identify a potential circle into our image. This mechanis is called
//VOTING PROCESS, and the logic behind it is simple: Given the entire SP, we must find WHICH point into the SP calculated through Hough has the maximum occurrences.
//Thats because, from the theory, we know that a point into the SP is surely a circle into the SI if his circle intersection number is maximum into the SP.
//That's works for ONE circle. For more than one line, we must set a threshold to let pass all the point with a given number of occurrence > than that threshold.
//Also, we need to set a MAXIMUM RADIUS and a MINIMUM RADIUS, to consider only the circle between that radius.
//Note: before operating with Hough we must works on border: let's do a reasonable Gaussian Blurring and a Canny edge detection.
